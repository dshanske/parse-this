Parse This turns URLs into structured jf2 data


## Description 

Parse This is based on a variety of projects including the parsing code from Press This, which was removed from WordPress. It supports parsing from
MF2 if present and for sites that are not marked up with Microformats 2(MF2) it will fall back onto parsing HTML/OpenGraph.

The goal is to produce structured jf2 data that can be used for previewing links as well as feed readers and other options. It can be installed
as a standalone plugin which will provide the necessary libraries and functionality as well as the REST API endpoint for getting JF2 data
from an arbitrary URL or a WordPress Post. It is also bundled in the Post Kinds plugin to provide similar functionality.
